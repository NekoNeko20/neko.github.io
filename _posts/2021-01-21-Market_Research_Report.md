### Research Objectives

This research mainly focuses on *Mining Potential Customers and Analyzing Traits For Stall Enocomies*. After the pandemic COVID-19, most large and medium-sized real economies have suffered severe setbacks, and their revenues greatly reduced. At the same time, because of the virus' superior infectious ability, most residents were required to be in quarantine at home. 

Nevertheless, after several months of isolation, residents walk out of their houses with their long-repressed social desire. And they also need some kind of stimulus to reignite consumption. Stall economy can be such a stimulus, for its convenience both for customers and vendors. Stall vendors only need a car for transporting and displaying goods, and interested stall customers will grab something when passing by. Many residents always choose to take a walk after meal, go to large shopping centers and markets. Stall vendors see this phenomenon as an opportunity, and provide relatively cheap commodities to attract customers.

However, problems still exist. The competition between the protection of city environment and economy development becomes extremely obvious under the stall economy situation. After Beijing allowed more vendors to set up on the road, on the square, many citizens complained that the environment is ruined, and vendors' forgetting to clean up the garbages had caused lots of unconvenience. Besides this, for many novices and specultors who want to start their own stalls, the choice of a suitable good to sell is hard to make. Even if they have chosen the suitable product, they will still have problems with their target crowd.

To solve these problems, we performed this investigation. The research object is Wuhan citizens. Because of the COVID-19, we cannot perform our supposed sampling procedure, which is a regret. This investigation will dive into the analysis of factors influencing citizens' choices of buying products, and clustering methods will be used to group these potential customers. We hope that this project can provide some advice for you.
