## Summary

I am currently a master student in information systems management at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz School of Information. Before, I interned at LinkedIn & MSRA and JD.com as machine learning researcher and engineer. My research focus is natural language processing, specifically in the area of pretraining-prompting. And I'm also interested in other directions! I have also participated collaboration project with CMU audio lab in the area of multi-modal machine learning in audio+nlp.

## Research


## A Bit More about Me

I did my undergraduate at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, majored in applied statistics. Outside of research and work, I'm passionate about many things. I'm always willing to accept recommendations and try new things. Here are my hobbies(which would be a reaaaaally long list lol):

- Video Games:
  - Boardgames & COC: My recent favourite this year, Akham Horror LCG, so great!
  - Video Games: Always stick to my PS5 and Switch, I'm Capcom fan and also a SEGA fan
- History
- Arts: Sometimes I draw commics for fun.
- Musics, Piano and Guitar: I'm recently considering setting up a band!
- Reading novels: big fan of McEwan
- Dancing

And my personal best game this year is Elden Ring!
