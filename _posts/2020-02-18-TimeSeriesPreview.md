## Time Series Preview

This is a memo page for time series course preview during winter vacation. This note contains some naive thoughts when reading James Douglas Hamilton's Time Series Analysis, Prof. Van der Vaart's  lecture notes on Time Series, which is really inspiring; also MIT's graduate course,[ Time Series Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-384-time-series-analysis-fall-2013/index.htm), taught by Prof. Anna Mikusheva, which is more like computational statistics. This simple note also covers some of Brockwell's Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, which is the first book I read in time series when I was in Berkeley.  If  interested in UCB time series course, you can see the course page: [Introduction to Time Series](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/courses/153-fall2010/index.html) .
